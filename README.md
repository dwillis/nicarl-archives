## The NICAR-L Improvement Project

Help make the NICAR-L archives more user-friendly by creating ways to identify and surface useful posts and threads. At a [2019 CAR Conference session](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3433/4362/), we'll discuss possible new ways to access the archives, a basic app to make things like up-voting and categorization possible and an initial roadmap. During this session, we will gather ideas and create a plan that we'll continue working on after the conference.

To start, IRE has very helpfully provided listserv archives from 2002 to the end of 2018. We'll make those available to session attendees, and this repository contains a basic Python parser for the log files and a CSV file with metadata from each of the postings.
